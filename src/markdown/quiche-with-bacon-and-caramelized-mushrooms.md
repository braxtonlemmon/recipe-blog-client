Something I really don’t love doing is making a pie crust. I’m optimistic and hope that one day I’ll grin and throw my hands in the air every time I get to make a crust, but that day has yet to come.

In the development process of today’s recipe, the quiche filling has undergone minor modifications, while the crust has been a real piece of work. When I first decided to create a quiche recipe, I did quite a bit of research regarding the ingredient ratios other people use in their quiche crust recipes. I made a chart, found the common ratios, and decided to do what felt right and just go for it. I added a bit too much flour and not quite enough water. The dough was overly-crumbly and split into a jigsaw puzzle when I tried to transfer it to the pie dish. The kitchen was not a happy place in those moments.

I patched together the crust the best I could, added the filling, and threw it in the oven. The flavor was superb and the filling looked great, but that crust. It was dense, undercooked, and just plain weird. I ate it, but I was pouty. I pushed the project to the side and moved on to other (easier?) endeavors.

Eventually I decided to quit being the baby I was being and returned, determined to pull a successful quiche out of my oven. I gathered more reading materials (online recipes, cookbooks, opinion articles) and extended my research. I have to say, there is a lot of contradictory crust-making advice out there. Use the freezer. Actually, stay out of the freezer. Use an egg. Wait, eggs are for the birds. Mix quickly with your fingers. No way, a metal blade in the food processor is way better than a finger. Confusing, you know what I mean?

Anyway, I combined and focused on a few methods that ultimately ended up working for me. I definitely would not call myself a pie crust expert, but what you have today is a crust I am satisfied with that represents my personal learning journey.

I’ll say a few things about the quiche itself and then leave you in peace to cook. A quiche is just a savory custard with extra bits, like meat and vegetables, added to it. Being a custard, the liquid base is naturally a combination of eggs, milk, and cream. As additions to the quiche, I chose to pair bacon, mushroom, shallot, and swiss cheese. All are fairly common in quiche recipes. When cooking the mushrooms, keep them in the pan a bit longer than you maybe normally would. I aimed for caramelized mushrooms. For this to happen, all the water inside of them needs to be cooked out. For me this took about five minutes per side over medium-high heat.

When the quiche is done, serve it warm or at room temperature. Enjoy and don’t hesitate to share any comments below!
