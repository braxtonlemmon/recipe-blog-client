Last month I was at the grocery store and noticed that fresh cranberries were on sale. It feels weird to have to modify the word “cranberries” with “fresh”, but I’ll admit my mind immediately paints a mental image of Craisins and blobs of canned sauce when I hear the word “cranberries.” Anyway, I bought the bag of on-sale cranberries. There was a vague idea of a dish I wanted to make with brussels sprouts, and the cranberries were the inspiration I needed to start putting the recipe together. 

Have you ever eaten a raw cranberry? Woah. When I popped one in my mouth and bit into it, I was immediately rushed back to elementary school playground days when me and my friends would dig Warheads out of our pockets and bust up laughing over the ridiculous faces we were making as our little seven-year-old taste buds were coated with the intense sourness. If you like sour, eat a raw cranberry.

I have something to say about the color profile of this dish. To my color-blind eyes, the pan of green and red looks nothing but normal. My friend, however, told me that the color combination looks “different.” With ten days left until Christmas, I think you’ll find this dish is the perfect addition to the holly and ivy hanging above your dinner table, the elf costume you may or may not be wearing, and the fir tree in your living room decorated with red ornaments.

About the actual recipe. This is a brussels sprouts recipe with a wide range of flavors. The bulk of the dish is made up of brussels sprouts. Before adding anything else, you will cook them until they begin to caramelize, adding a sweet, slightly-charred taste to the overall dish. Then we have bacon, one of the most common brussels sprouts pairings. The bacon provides a salty, savory addition. If you’re very short on time or ingredients, you could stop here and be happy. It’s hard to go wrong with brussels sprouts and bacon. You, however, are dedicated. So you’re not stopping here, riggggght?

Add walnuts and suddenly the texture of the dish improves dramatically. The earthy, nutty flavor is a bonus as well. What makes this dish really shine is the cranberries. From what I’ve read, overcooking cranberries can cause an overly bitter flavor experience. This is why you’ll only cook them for the last ten minutes on the stovetop. As they cook, they will soften. The overall result will be a tangy flavor that fits perfectly with the caramelized brussels sprouts. 

At the very end of cooking you will add the dressing. The quantity of dressing is not intended to drown the ingredients in the skillet, but you can always scale up on ingredients when making the  dressing if you feel like the dish needs more. 

This is one of those recipes where I consider every ingredient to be extremely important when it comes to the overall flavor. I’m definitely guilty of omitting one or two ingredients when following a recipe because I don’t have it on hand or don’t want to buy it at the grocery store. If possible, don’t make that mistake with this recipe. Enjoy and let me know how it goes!
