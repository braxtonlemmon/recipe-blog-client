Do you want guaranteed money for you and your family for the next 365 days? Keep reading! This upcoming February 2nd, make a crepe in a frying pan (sure, you can use my recipe, why not) and place a gold coin in your non-flipping hand (I’ll send the first person who reads this and contacts me a complimentary gold coin). Now, grab the pan handle, keep that gold coin in your other hand, and flip the crepe. If you pull off a clean flip, that’s money for you and your family for one year. If not, get rid of that coin because you lose, sorry. Some solid superstition straight from France.

Now, what to do with your money-making crepe? I’ll tell you. Fill it with just the right combination of flavors and turn it into your next meal. Here I present you with my selection of ingredients and steps for my favorite savory crepes. 

Don’t overcook the crepes, or they will start to resemble large wafers and will crack and crumble as they are rolled. Just make sure you preheat the pan long enough and keep it at a relatively high temperature. The batter will cook through while leaving you with those nice brown spots we all like to see on our crepes. And remember to add a pat of butter to the pan between crepes. 

Another suggestion (requirement) for this meal is to leave the yolks of your fried eggs runny. The yolk essentially acts as the sauce for the crepe. The last thing you want to do is cut into your crepe and find a dry, crumbly yolk. 

The amount of mustard you spread is up to you. I usually do about 1 teaspoon per crepe, but it all depends on how strong the mustard is. You don’t want mustard overkill, but the flavor should definitely be present. 

One last thing. I don’t mention it in the instructions (you’re getting the inside scoop, yo), but once I’ve assembled the crepe, I usually gently place it back in the pan and cook it for about one minute per side before serving on a plate and topping with the green onion, parsley, and pepper.
It’s not necessary, but it gives the crepe a nice toast and raises the temperature a degree or two before serving.
