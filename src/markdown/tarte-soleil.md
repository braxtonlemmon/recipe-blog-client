title: tarte-soleil

The day may come when you decide to make a tarte soleil (translated to “sun tart”) not because you are hungry, not because you need a killer appetizer for a dinner party, but because you want to see something that looks so incredibly beautiful come out of your oven. If made for viewing-only purposes, this tarte should last uncovered on your countertop for several weeks. 

For a successful tarte soleil, your geometric skills need to be top notch. The pattern of rays extending from the middle will be beautiful when the pattern of rays extending from the middle is consistent. Remember that. I normally go with 16 rays, but the choice is up to you. However many you choose, be gentle when making the 360 degrees twist, and keep the corkscrew section closer to the middle. Leave the end of each ray wide and flat or the ray will end up a bit spindly and weird.

You may find that the rim of the baking sheet gets in the way when trying to cut the rays. If this worries you, just layer a couple sheets of parchment paper on top of a large cutting board, prepare the tarte on the paper, cut the rays, and then transfer the entire thing to the baking sheet. I say a couple sheets of parchment paper because I often cut through the first paper layer when cutting, which makes the transfer nearly impossible. Having that extra layer of paper should ensure you have a solid base to make the transfer.

The super duper thing about everything is that you can play with several variations on a theme when choosing ingredients. I’ve suggested my favorite combination - ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes, basil - but I’ve also enjoyed other combos like goat cheese and bacon or pesto and parmesan. Just recently I came across a recipe for a churro-like tarte soleil. Mmhmm.

Don’t stress out too much about this one. Have fun with it and it will turn out great. Treat it more like a 3rd grade art project than a cooking project. Remember those glory days? The dough is your playdough, the egg yolk your toxic-free paint, and the sesame seeds your...sprinkles.
