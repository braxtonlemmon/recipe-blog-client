Several months ago my friend and I went to Brussels to explore a park north of the city and check out the wild monument called the Atomium. Google it, it’s fun to look at. During our day trip we stopped at a Syrian restaurant called Les Nuits de Cham. We ordered a large mezze platter and a pot of sweet mint tea to share. While everything was incredibly tasty, one of the eggplant dips in particular blew me away. It was smoky, contained no tahini like a typical baba ganoush, and had a tanginess that made each bite extremely exciting.

Feeling inspired, I went home and purchased a handful of eggplants. I experimented with various ways of roasting an eggplant: whole, halved, cubed, with oil, without oil, etc. After several trials and a little taste testing help, I came to my conclusion. The whole roasted eggplant contained too much liquid and resulted in a watery dip, while the cubed eggplant was a bit too dry. While these issues potentially could have been fixed by adjusting temperature or roasting time, I was most pleased with the roasted eggplant halves and decided to use this method when developing the dip.

In this recipe you will roast the eggplant halves for nearly an hour. Yes, an hour is a long time, but I’ve come up with something for you to do while you wait: caramelize an onion. Exciting, I know. The onion adds a subtle sweetness to the dip that balances out the tanginess that comes from the eggplant. The onion will reduce in size greatly when caramelizing, and you will end up with only about ⅓ of a cup. That’s what you want.

Most likely your eggplants are still roasting. Perfect. That gives you just enough time to chop up a tomato and give it a quick pan fry. Don’t keep it in the pan for too long as it could burn and create some unwanted off-flavors. The idea is to evaporate some of the water from the tomato and soften it for the dip.

The eggplants are done roasting once they are extremely tender and when most of the flesh has lost its whiteness. Remove the eggplants from the oven and give them a few minutes to slightly cool down. When they cool down enough that you can tolerate handling them (it may still feel a bit like you are playing a game of hot potato), scrape the eggplant flesh into a colander and discard the skins. Five minutes in the colander is long enough to allow some of the excess liquid to drain away. This prevents the dip from having too much liquid.

The time has come! All the ingredients meet together for a puree party, which results in a smoky, tangy dip that can be served either warm or at room temperature. Toast a few pitas, slice a cucumber, and enjoy your creation.
