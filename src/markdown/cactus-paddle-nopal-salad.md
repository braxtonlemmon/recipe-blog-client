You may have noticed that my last recipe was published back in July. The hawk-eyed readers among you will then notice that "July" was thirteen months ago. Oops. Oh well, I’m back and fingers-crossed I’m here to stay. Please don’t shame me, and please make this recipe.

I recently took a trip to Guadalajara, Mexico. The trip was fairly spontaneous and my travel style during it ended up being quite different than what I’m used to. Normally I spend a minimal amount of time exploring a city and spend the majority of my travel time doing non-city activities like hiking, hopping around on rocks, and sitting on buses and trains for way too long. This trip ended up being a mostly stationary, in-the-city, culinary-oriented adventure. I consumed so many unique meals and drinks, and my taste buds just totally exploded. What you are making today was inspired by a specific meal I enjoyed on the last day of my trip. Shout out to the chef who patiently spoke Spanish slowly enough for me to comprehend more or less his preferred way of preparing nopales.

If you’ve never eaten cactus before, imagine eating a tart, raw green bean. While not exactly the same, I find them not too dissimilar. It’s pretty common to see recipes that have you steam, boil, or sautee cactus paddles. Today, however, you will not be doing any cooking with heat, rather you’ll be using salt to cure the cactus paddles. Yay for not heating up the kitchen in the summer!

Cactus paddles, like okra, contain large amounts of mucilage. Mucilage is that slimy goop that comes out as you cook something like okra or cactus. Eating the slimy substance is not the most enjoyable, so by coating the cactus in salt and allowing it to rest, you are able to draw out much of that mucilage. Then, after a few nice water baths, the cactus strips will be relatively slime-free and ready to hang out with their tomato, jalapeño, and onion friends.

This cactus paddle concoction can easily be served alone as a side dish, as well as a condiment for tacos or any other meal you decide to serve. Most likely I will reference this recipe down the road when I publish other recipes that utilize it as a condiment. So no better time than now to start practicing, you know.
