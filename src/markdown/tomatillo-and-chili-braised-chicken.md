When I was a kid I loved rearranging the furniture in my bedroom (after I graduated from a sibling-shared living space, of course). My feng shui practice was top notch. Sometimes I would just sit and brainstorm the next layout. The ideas would click in my brain. Rotate the bed ninety-degrees. Swap the dresser to the opposite wall. Place the small desk in the corner. Move the monkey that sucks his thumb front-and-center of all the stuffed animals. It worked in my brain, and as long as I was strong enough to push things around, it worked in practice.

That mental gift returned when creating this recipe. I spent a good week envisioning in my brain the components for the meal you are about to make and enjoy. It feels good when that sort of inspiration comes along, and even better when I can refine the mental imagery into an actual recipe.

Now let’s talk about collagen. Collagen seems to be a buzzword these days. I haven’t really looked into why, but I do know I have walked down grocery store aisles and have seen plastic tubs advertising collagen you can put in a milkshake maybe? Anyway. The collagen we’re talking about today is found in chicken thighs. It’s that collagen that ultimately makes chicken thighs and legs silky and tender when cooked right.

What I’m about to tell you may not sound appetizing, but it is what it is, and is just a hard-fact about the food we eat as voluntary meat eaters. Collagen is a protein and is found in abundance in chicken thighs and legs. Well, collagen starts to melt at around 150° F or so (the temperature is debatable, according to what I’ve read. Correct me if you actually know.). This melting is more scientifically called denaturation. So the collagen denatures and ends up turning into gelatin. What is gelatin like? Tender and silky. At 185° F, your chicken reaches maximum gelatin levels.

The result of all this is an extremely tender piece of meat. If you had stopped cooking the chicken at the normal 160° F, like you would a chicken breast, the thigh meat would still be quite chewy as the collagen-to-gelatin conversion would just be starting. There is a bit of give and take with the whole process. The longer chicken cooks, the more moisture it will lose. In the case of thighs or legs, the gelatin makes up for it.

Today you will be cooking chicken thighs until they reach 185° F. To do this, you will braise them in a sauce for nearly half an hour. The sauce consists of several roasted ingredients. The garlic cloves and chilies will be roasted on the stovetop, while the tomatillos and jalapeño will go under the broiler for a nice char-treatment. It all gets combined with onion and tomato in the food processor and results in a smoky puree.

The braised chicken and tomatillo chili sauce are served with some seasoned rice. Combining turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, and cayenne pepper, you’ll end up with a pot of colorful, flavorful rice. When it comes time to serve, the dish gets topped with a sprinkling of cilantro and a handful of pumpkin seeds. Enjoy.
