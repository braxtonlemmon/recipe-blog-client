I have crafted an ode to the mighty sheet pan:

<em>Your rectangular shape is unceasing,</em>
<br>
<em>My respect for you daily increasing,</em>
<br>
<em>In the oven you bake,</em>
<br>
<em>In the fridge you hold cake,</em>
<br>
<em>So I’ll keep you around for a while.</em>
<br>

But really, sheet pans are where it’s at. They come in a variety of sizes, they nest inside each other for storage, and they are a dream to clean if you use parchment paper or a silicone mat. If you haven’t expressed gratitude for your sheet pan recently, take a brief moment the next time you two meet up to do so. Today’s recipe uses a sheet pan, so that moment of gratitude might come sooner than you were expecting.

A few months ago I read a recipe for a sheet pan sausage dish that was written in a single paragraph. No specific ingredients, no quantities, and no explicit instructions. Just a brief explanation written by a chef about how he prepares the dish. Although the paragraph gave me little direction, it inspired me to go about creating my own recipe that features roasting sausages and vegetables on a sheet pan in the oven. I really wish I could remember where I read the aforementioned paragraph, but sadly I nor Google Chrome History can do so. We’re lame-o’s, I know.

I’ve made this dish on several occasions, each time trying a different type of sausage. The particular version pictured on this page was made with boudin blanc sausages. I think this may be my favorite sausage to cook with this dish. With that said, be brave when at the supermarket and snag the type of sausage off the shelf that <em>you</em> would like to eat. It’s hard to go wrong, and it’s good to experiment. Did that last sentence come from a fortune cookie? Good question.

What really makes this dish a gem is the congregation of vegetables that are roasted alongside the sausages. Carrots offer a warm, homey flavor. Bell peppers radiate that classic roasted-bell-pepper taste and smell. Onions petals char at the edges and offer a sweet, toned-down onion flavor. Tomatoes soften in texture, while still providing a juicy bite. Dried thyme and dried red pepper flakes are sprinkled over everything to give everything just a little extra oomph.

The secret is to keep the sheet pan goodies in the oven for a short period of time at a high temperature, hence setting the oven to broil. Cook the vegetables for too long, and they’ll lose the fresh, crisp texture you are aiming for. Cook the vegetables at a lower temperature and you won’t get the charred skin and edges that provide the “roasted” flavor.

If you need a relatively easy dinner party trick, this is a good one.
