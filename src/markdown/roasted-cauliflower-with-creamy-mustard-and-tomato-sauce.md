Meet the mustards. When reading about cauliflower on the www, I found out that the vegetable is part of a family of plants called the mustards! Technically the family is named Brassicaceae, but who knows how to pronounce that one? So cauliflower and the plants that yield the seeds used to make Grey Poupon Dijon and French’s 100% Yellow go to the same family reunions. 

So this recipe has cauliflower and mustard. Raw cauliflower dipped in ranch on a veggie tray and hot, roasted cauliflower with charred tips are two completely different experiences. I would pick the latter any day.  

Roasted cauliflower florets are the premier performers in this dish, but we make room for a red bell pepper at the roasting party. The pepper eventually ends up in the sauce. If you prefer to roast the pepper over an open flame or in some other way apart from the cauliflower, go ahead. In this recipe it all happens on the same pan in the same oven, but that’s more out of convenience.

When developing this recipe I increased the amount of mustard in the dish until the flavor was just noticeable without being overpowering. Brown mustard is used for its spiciness. Depending on your love for mustard, feel free to experiment with both the kind and amount of mustard you add.

Lastly, try to assemble and serve this dish as close as possible to the time the cauliflower comes out of the oven. Enjoy!
