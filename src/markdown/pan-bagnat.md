title: pan-bagnat
---

Working a little language translation magic, we find out that the French title “pan bagnat” is “bathed bread” in English. This is a meal from the south of France, one you can imagine yourself enjoying on a sunny day on the Mediterranean coast with a crisp rosé at your side.

The pan bagnat was initially a budget-friendly sandwich eaten by poor French people in the 19th century. It was made with old bread, some water to soften that old bread, and a few vegetables from the season. Sometimes, if wages were high and market prices were low, anchovies were purchased and added to the sandwich. At some point a bourgeois version came about that swapped the anchovies with tuna and added a nice drizzle of olive oil to the bread. These days the divide between the “poor” and “rich” versions has disappeared, and most variations are based on preference.

If you happen to be an expert in southern French cuisine you’ll immediately notice from the photo of this recipe that I’ve used the wrong bread. You’ve caught me, I’m a fake, and I apologize. The real deal is made with a round loaf of bread called “pain de campagne.” Find a round loaf if you want the whole experience to be a bit more authentic, but the sandwich will be no less incredible if you use a baguette as is pictured on this page.

There is no standard as to how long the sandwich needs to sit before eating. I’ve seen recipes (usually in French cookbooks and blogs) that suggest eating immediately, and I’ve seen other recipes that suggest waiting an entire 24 hours before digging in. I leave the sandwich for one hour at room temperature and find it to be long enough for the bread to soften from the dressing, but not so long that the crispness of the vegetables disappears.

If you are anti-anchovies, use anchovies. Maybe this sandwich will grant you the acquired taste. They’re extremely salty and quite pungent, but there are so many ingredients piled into the bread that the flavors balance out and the anchovy power is reduced. If you are really, seriously anti-anchovies, use tuna.

I’m excited for you to try this one out. Some vegetables might fall out as you take a bite and the tomato juice might drip down your arm, but it’s totally worth it. And remember, no mayonnaise on this one.
