Christmas lights are going up early this year. The pandemic is ridiculously difficult on everyone, so inviting the annual feel-good season a few weeks early seems like a good idea to me. If it’s in your power to make your home environment a little jollier, do it. With all that said, here’s a comfort-stew that pairs well with the early arrival of the holiday season.

<!-- Here’s the thing about this dish: it’s mostly beef. While I personally don’t stick to a vegetarian diet, I normally try to limit my meat consumption to a few times a week. More cows = more greenhouse gases. And that’s bad. Right, why don’t I just cut out meat altogether. Limiting my meat consumption is just a point between completely avoiding meat and not caring at all, and it’s the eating habit I’ve decided to adopt. That’s all. Anyway, what I’m trying to say with all this is  that you shouldn’t make this dish a nightly ritual. -->

Carbonnade! If you’ve ever had beef bourguignon, it’s extremely similar. Beef bourguignon is a French stew made with beef and wine. Cross the northeast border of France and you’ll find the same dish with one major difference: beer is used instead of wine. For this dish try to find a dark, malty beer. For the authentic experience, pick something Belgian. Chimay, Westmalle, and St. Bernardus are all great options. I used Westmalle Dubbel for the particular version pictured on this page.

I’m not Belgian, so everything I know about this dish comes from the couple years I spent living in Belgium. From what I experienced, carbonnade is a classic comfort meal. I’ve been told it’s one of those recipes that has been passed on from grandma to grandma to grandma. Why grandma is always passing down the recipe and never grandpa is a mystery to me - I’m just telling you what I’ve been told.

Here’s what happens with this dish. First, the beef spends a few hours marinating in the chosen ale before being seared on the stovetop. The onions are then sautéed. Finally, the beef, onions, marinade, and all remaining ingredients are combined into one pot and are cooked in the oven at a low temperature for at least two hours. The beef becomes tender, the collection of flavors meld, and the smell from your kitchen will magically gather every single person in your house into one room.

Carbonnade is normally accompanied by some form of potatoes, with fries being the most common. Belgian fries are fried not once, but twice. So if you don’t feel like attempting to make a batch of Belgian fries, get your hands on some crispy french fries to serve with the stew.

As they say in Belgium, eet smakelijk (enjoy your meal)!
