title: shakshouka

A few years ago I was on a search for camping meals that don’t involve Top Ramen, canned bean and bacon soup, or pouches of dehydrated sludge. My friend and I perused the web and came up with a list of novel ideas to break up the Friday night camp stove monotony. One recipe, with an unfamiliar title, stole the show. Shakshouka. While not feasible as a backpacking meal, this dish has become a favorite in both the kitchen and at the car-camping picnic table. Sidenote: modifications are necessary if you decide to make this recipe while camping.

Apparently, like so many other dishes, no one reallllly knows where shakshouka originated. Turkey? Morocco? Yemen? Good question. Wherever it’s actually from, shakshouka remains popular in North Africa and the Middle East. 

In a nutshell, shakshouka is composed of stewed, spiced vegetables, (usually) tomatoes, (sometimes) minced meat, and various other toppings depending on who’s running the show in the kitchen. Well, I’m running the show today, and we’ll be topping our shakshouka with feta, fresh parsley, and some freshly ground black pepper.

You can see I’ve prepared the dish in a cast-iron skillet. Acidic ingredients, like tomatoes, react with the iron and can ruin the seasoning of your skillet and cause your food to taste metallic. If your skillet is well-seasoned, the cooking time is short enough so that there shouldn’t be a problem. Just be sure to transfer all the contents of the pan to serving bowls or tupperware soon after everything is finished cooking. If your skillet is relatively new, unused, or recently reseasoned, go with a stainless-steel or enamel-coated pan.

I add a couple sliced fresh tomatoes to complement the large amount of canned tomatoes. And notice I’ve used the word sliced. My favorite way to prepare this dish is to slice the bell peppers, the onion, and the fresh tomatoes. No worries if you prefer to dice the vegetables, but I think the sliced version gives the stew a heartier texture.

When it’s time to serve, provide either crusty bread or pitas so everyone can sop up the remaining tomato sauce at the end of the meal.
