Here we are, more or less nearing the end of peach season. This one is a tribute to our fuzzy friends. To start, spin up the song “Peaches” by the 90s grunge-rock band The Presidents of the United States of America. Put that track on infinite repeat. As soon as you hear the first few guitar strums, verify the volume is at rock level, and take your rightful place in the kitchen. You are now absolutely ready.

What you are about to cook has four primary components. Savory pork, sweet peaches, peppery basil, and an energetic sauce. The pork/peach/basil combination is plastered all over the internet. I decided to take this trio and create a punchy sauce that would be tamed by the thick sweetness of the peaches. The power of the sauce comes from a blend of a few intense ingredients - shallots, ginger, garlic, strong mustard, and horseradish. Exciting, amirite??

Technically I think you could call this one a one-pot wonder. Everything (the searing, the pan-frying, the braising, the broiling) happened in my prized 12-inch cast iron skillet. How much do I love my cast iron skillet, you might ask? Enough to hand-wrap it in paper towels and bubble-wrap and move it across the Atlantic not once, but twice. Shout out to you, cast iron skillet. With that said, all you really need is an oven-proof pan with a lid. The choice is yours.

When searing the pork, inactivity is key. The recipe says to sear for three minutes per side. That means laying the pork chops in the hot skillet at timer reading 0:00 and not moving them at all until about three minutes later.

When it comes time to braise, refrain from adding the peaches to the pan unless you want fall-apart, cobbler-like peaches. Wait until the braising period is over to add the peaches. The quick broil at the end will heat the peaches and ideally result in a few caramelized edges. Seal the deal by topping the whole dish with freshly chopped basil leaves. 

As a serving suggestion, I recommend a side of quinoa. Spoon some of the extra sauce from the pan onto the quinoa and complete the whole thing with a few grinds of black pepper. Enjoy.
