## My Story

Did I grow up cooking? If you count microwaving frozen burritos, mixing together ice cream and chocolate syrup in a blender, and smearing globs of peanut butter and jelly on Wonder bread, then yes, I grew up cooking. In all reality, it wasn't until I was in university that I first experienced the magic of the kitchen. In my small college dorm I baked my first chicken breast. It was unseasoned, dry, and flavorless, but I was overjoyed and gave myself a solid pat on the back. I began to attempt other culinary projects. Gazing into the grimy window of our small oven, my jaw dropped as I saw my first batch of pitas transform from a thin disk to an inflated UFO in a matter of seconds. When making pasta I remembered hearing somewhere that pasta is done if it sticks to the wall, so I would toss a few noodles up onto the ceiling for good measure. 

A couple years later I saw a job posting for a "salsa maker" position at a grocery store. I drove to the store, found the manager, and started work soon after. After being trained, I was on my own making and packaging fresh salsa to be sold in the produce section. One evening at work I had just finished chopping one red, one yellow, and one orange bell pepper. I paused, looked at the peppers on the cutting board and the bowl of tomatoes in front of me, and suddenly felt a surge of satisfaction. As trivial as it sounds, in that moment I realized that I have a penchant for taking raw consumable ingredients and turning them into flavourful works of art. Since then my zeal for cooking has continually grown. 

Inspired by my salsa making job, I opened a stand at the local farmer's market where I sold my fresh guacamole, tomatillo salsa, and a creamy cilantro dip. The experience was thrilling and motivated me to find other ways of sharing my food creations with people. I began to host events at my house called Tunes and Tastes. I would stage the living room for a casual house show or open-mic night and spend the day before preparing food for the event. These days I am active as ever in the kitchen. My food is primarily shared among family and friends, with the occasional dinner party every now and then.

My general culinary interests evolve constantly, but I am regularly influenced by local cuisine. I grew up in the American South and then spent several years in the Western United States. Additionally I have spent several years living in South America and most recently Europe. Each location has fueled my culinary creativity and has shaped my approach to how I interact with food. 

WHAT?

Taste drives my actions. I pay little attention to the flashy labels that tattoo most supermarket products and instead
I have minimal experience catering to dietary needs and this is reflected in my recipes. My primary goal is to share and keep a record of my favorite creations and allow everyone who follows a recipe to adjust it accordingly.

## Why make a recipe blog?
My motivation to create this blog comes from several sources:
- Being a relatively new web developer, I wanted a project that allows me to implement both my frontend and backend skills. 

  For those interested in knowing the tech stack behind Peel the Garlic:
    - The site you are viewing is built with Gatsby and deployed with Netlify.
    - My administrative interface was built with Create React App and deployed with Netlify.
    - I built the API using Node.js and Serverless.
    - I use MongoDB as my database.
    - I use AWS to host my recipe photographs and my API.

- Over the years I have become frustrated with several aspects of many modern recipe blogs:
    - Unit systems
      
      Most blogs use solely either the Imperial system or the Metric system. I have serious issues with the Imperial system as measurements tend to be ambiguous and inconsistent. My preference is the Metric system as I find it much easier to use a scale for measuring ingredients. For this reason I have decided to include both units in each list of ingredients. 
      
    - Visibility
      
      I'm annoyed when I read a recipe step that says something like, "now add the oil, all the spices except for cumin, and the nuts," and have to scroll back up the page to remember how much of each ingredient is needed. Even worse, I then have to scroll back down the page and find again the step I had just read. For this reason I have designed my recipe pages in a way that allows you to visibily mark your progress through the lists of ingredients and steps. Your progress will be saved in your browser and will allow to return to the page later to continue where you left off. Additionally, the ingredient list will remain fixed as a side column on the page for display screens that are tablet-sized and larger. Unfortunately there is not a practical solution to this problem if you are using a small mobile-sized display.

    - Page bloat
      
      I know that in order to be noticed on the internet a blog typically needs to be filled with a good amount of content and media both on the surface and behind the scenes. As a result, it seems that many recipe blogs require an excessive amount of time to load (if they ever fully load). Sometimes the pictures load slower than the text, or the ads appear after you've already started reading. This sometimes results in an annoyingly jumpy experience. My goal is to maintain a minimalist website. If down the road I find that this is not possible I will eat my hat and make a public apology.


## Why 'Peel the Garlic'?

Peeling garlic is a tedious task. Sometimes the skin peels off easily, but often removing the skin involves scraping, picking, and whittling with a knife or a fingernail. Once the skin is off, you are left with a naked clove and a small pile of crÃªpe paper-like flakes that scatter if you exhale too quickly. Sprinkling garlic powder from a container or scooping minced garlic from a jar is much easier and doesn't leave a pungent scent on your fingertips. The flavor of that fresh garlic though, is unbeatable. The effort it takes to peel a clove or two is worth it to me and represents my cooking philosophy. Spending time in the kitchen rejuvenates me. The process of dedicating hours to a meal and final product that is so temporary, that will be consumed at the table in less than fifteen minutes, has an artistic quality to it that inspires me to put on my apron and fire up the stovetop every single day.

While I appreciate the ease that comes along with a speedy meal, my favorite culinary experiences usually involve hours of involvement and attention to detail. Long drawn-out recipes aren't the norm on Peel the Garlic, but I just want you to be aware that I don't guarantee quick and convenient dishes as speed is not my priority.
Cooking one-pot meals with pre-chopped ingredients in ten minutes is fine and sometimes necessary, but my belief is that everyone should regularly find time to set aside to cook and leisurely enjoy eating the food they've prepared with friends and family. It's okay to slow down and peel the garlic.
