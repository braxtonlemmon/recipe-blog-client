## Why 'Peel the Garlic'?

Peeling garlic is a tedious task. Sometimes the skin peels off easily, but more often than not, removing the skin involves scraping, picking, and whittling with a knife or a fingernail. Once the skin is off, you are left with a naked clove and a small pile of crÃªpe paper-like flakes that scatter if you exhale too quickly. Sprinkling garlic powder from a container or scooping minced garlic from a jar is much easier and doesn't leave a permanently pungent scent on your fingertips. The flavor of that fresh garlic though, is unbeatable. The effort it takes to peel a clove or two is worth it to me and represents my cooking philosophy. Spending time in the kitchen rejuvenates me. The process of dedicating hours to a meal and a final product that is so temporary, that will be consumed at the table in one sitting, has an artistic quality to it that inspires me to put on my apron and fire up the stovetop every single day.

While I appreciate the ease that comes along with a speedy meal, my favorite culinary experiences usually involve hours of involvement and attention to detail. Long drawn-out recipes aren't the norm on Peel the Garlic, but I just want you to be aware that I don't guarantee quick and convenient dishes, as speed is not my priority. Cooking one-pot meals with pre-chopped ingredients in ten minutes is fine and sometimes necessary when things get busy, but my belief is that everyone should regularly find time to set aside for cooking and appreciating food either alone or with friends and family. It's okay to slow down and peel the garlic.

## My Story

Did I grow up cooking? If you count microwaving frozen burritos, mixing together ice cream and chocolate syrup in a blender, and smearing globs of peanut butter and jelly on Wonder bread, then yes, I grew up cooking. In all reality, it wasn't until I was in university that I first experienced the magic of the kitchen. In my small college dorm I baked my first chicken breast. It was unseasoned, dry, and flavorless, but I was overjoyed and gave myself a solid pat on the back. I began to attempt other culinary projects. Gazing into the grimy window of our small oven, my jaw dropped as I saw my first batch of pitas transform from a thin disk to an inflated UFO in a matter of seconds. When making pasta I remembered hearing somewhere that pasta is done if it sticks to the wall, so I would toss a few noodles up onto the ceiling for good measure. 

A couple years later I saw a job posting for a "salsa maker" position at a grocery store. I drove to the store, found the manager, and started work soon after. After being trained, I was on my own making and packaging fresh salsa to be sold in the produce section. One evening at work I had just finished chopping one red, one yellow, and one orange bell pepper. I paused, looked at the peppers on the cutting board and the bowl of tomatoes in front of me, and suddenly felt a surge of satisfaction. As trivial as it sounds, in that moment I realized that I have a penchant for taking raw consumable ingredients and turning them into flavourful works of art. Since then my zeal for cooking has continually grown. 

Inspired by my salsa making job, I opened a stand at the local farmer's market where I sold my fresh guacamole, tomatillo salsa, and a creamy cilantro dip. The experience was thrilling and motivated me to find other ways of sharing my food creations with people. I began to host events at my house called Tunes and Tastes. I would stage the living room for a casual house show or open-mic night and spend the day before preparing food for the event. These days I am active as ever in the kitchen. My food is primarily shared among family and friends, with the occasional dinner party every now and then.

My general culinary interests evolve constantly, but I am regularly influenced by local cuisine. I grew up in the American South and then spent several years in the Western United States. Additionally I have spent several years living in South America and most recently Europe. Each location has fueled my culinary creativity and has shaped my approach to how I interact with food. 

## Why did I make a recipe blog?
<!-- My motivation to create this blog comes from several sources: -->

### COOKING IS AWESOME
I don't have much more to say about this one. I love cooking. I love web development. A recipe blog is the perfect combination.

### WEB DEVELOPMENT
Over the past couple years I have been learning web development full-time by following an incredible open-source curriculum called The Odin Project. This recipe blog acts as a personal capstone project that allows me to implement both my front-end and back-end development skills. 

The site you are viewings is built with Gatsby and deployed with Netlify. My administrative interface was built with Create React App and also deployed with Netlify. I built the API for Peel the Garlic using Node.js and Serverless. My database is hosted on MongoDB. I use AWS to host my recipe photographs and my API.

### TO IMPROVE THE COOKING EXPERIENCE

Sometimes when viewing recipe blogs I imagine what the ideal online recipe experience would be like. Peel the Garlic attempts to provide the following:
  - #### 1) Accessibility: quantities listed    in both weight and volume

    While living in France I purchased a few cookbooks. Excited to test my French and cook something new, I cracked open the book, selected a recipe, and looked at the list of ingredients. Immediately I noticed that the quantity of most items was indicated by weight in grams. I went to the store, purchased a kitchen scale, and it has since been a permanent feature on my kitchen counter. While I agree that exact measurements are usually not as vital in cooking as in baking, I love being able to place a bowl on the scale and add a certain weight of each ingredient without having to measure by volume with cups or spoons. 
    
    I want my recipes to be accessible at an international level, so I attempt to indicate ingredient quantities using both volume and weight. I have a preference for the Metric system and have therefore decided to use it as the primary unit in my recipes.  
    
  - #### 2) Visibility: see ingredients and steps simultaneously
    
    I regularly use a laptop or phone when following a recipe. Often I will reach a recipe step that says something like, "now add the oil, the nuts, and all the spices except for cumin" and have to scroll back up the page to remember how much of each ingredient is needed. Even worse, I then have to scroll back down the page and find again the step I had just read. For this reason I have designed my recipe pages in a way that allows you to visibily mark your progress through the lists of ingredients and steps. Your progress will be saved in your browser and will allow you to return to the page at a later time to continue where you left off. Additionally, the list of ingredients will remain fixed as a side column on the page for display screens that are tablet-sized and larger.
