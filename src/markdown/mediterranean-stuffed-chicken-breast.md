The original idea for this recipe came to me when preparing for a camping trip. Camp cooking for me is nearly as enjoyable as cooking in my kitchen, so I don't put many limitations on how involved a meal might be in the great outdoors.

With that said, I have to be honest with you. I wrote that first paragraph months ago. And finishing this description has been the only thing preventing this lovely recipe from appearing on your screen.

The wait is over and I'm letting this writeup sliddddeeee. Cook and enjoy!
